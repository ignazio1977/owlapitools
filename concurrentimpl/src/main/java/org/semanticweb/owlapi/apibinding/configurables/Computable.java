/** This class represents a computable task to be used when filling a
 * MemoizingCache; the results to be stored in the cache, i.e., the return value
 * of compute(), are expected to be non null, although it is not forbidden to
 * have a null value; if that case is expected to be frequent, then the use of a
 * cache is not sensible. The expected code pattern looks like this:<br>
 * MemoizingCache&lt;A, B&gt; cache = new MemoizingCache&lt;A, B&gt;();<br>
 * A key = ...;<br>
 * Computable&lt;B&gt; c = new Computable&lt;B&gt;{...};<br>
 * B toReturn = cache.get(c, key);<br>
 * if(c.hasThrownException()){<br>
 * throw c.thrownException();<br>
 * }<br>
 * When refactoring code where the computation of the toReturn value was
 * inlined, this reproduces the behaviour of the refactored code; casting of the
 * Throwable returned may be needed.
 * 
 * @param <V>
 *            type of computed result */
